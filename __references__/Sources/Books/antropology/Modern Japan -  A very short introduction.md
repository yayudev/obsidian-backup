### Introduction: What's modern about modern Japan?

##### Preconceptions of modern Japan
- Japan has a mixture of traditional culture and hyper #modernity, the mysterious and the technological.
- Japan is seen as an enigmatically different *other* that has somehow appropriated and transformed the trappings of western #modernity.
- Japan is considered the first **modern** (as in western-like) "non-western" nation in history. 

##### What's in "modern" anyway?
- #Modernity refers to a more-or-less specific constellation of intellectual, social, political and scientific norms and practices.
- There's a lack of consensus on the definition of "modern".
- A society may be considered modern if it exhibits signs of industrialization and urbanization.
- An economy may be considered modern if it boasts a market economy organized according to #capitalism principles.
- A political system may be considered modern if it's organized around a central nation-state, supported by popular #nationalism, and a representative system of government (perhaps a democracy) that gives voice to the will of people.
- Modern consciousness involves the awareness of dignity of individuals and inalienable rights.
- **The modern era is held by reason rather than by superstition, and the development of science and technology** — the mechanization of society.
- It shares the #enlightenment project's faith in progress and its aspirations towards the universalism of its maxims.
- Modern is the opposite to tradition — the overcoming of traditional (***irrational***) ways of organizing life.
- However, modern era is not and end to cultural diversity, is engaging with traditions but in a transformed way: recognizing them as *traditions* rather than *truths*.

	- Peasants are disarmed and weapons are only legally allowed for the #Samurai class.
	- #Oda-Nobunaga rejects the title of #shogun because he didn't want to be seen as a subordinate to the emperor.
- 1582
	- #Toyotomi-Hideyoshi succeeds #Oda-Nobunaga.
- 1592
	- Struggling to legitimize his position and deal with the political instability, #Toyotomi-Hideyoshi tries to invade #Korea but fails.
- 1597
	- #Toyotomi-Hideyoshi attempts to invade #Korea again, but fails and is left with economical issues and an undermined status.
- 1598

	- Contact with Japan's neighbours is limited by edict.
	- #Toyotomi-Hideyoshi dies this year as well.

	- The position of #shogun becomes hereditary.
- 1641 
	- An official policy ( #sakoku ) is stablished to forbid foreigners from entering the mainland, with the exception of a small number of Dutch traders in #Deshima.

##### 1600 - 1868 Tokugawa Regime
>*Note: Specific dates are not detailed but events are secuential* 
- Tokugawa regime creates the #bakuhan-taisei, a feudal political system that links the #bakufu and the #han into a single *taisei* (system).
- This began a sense of national identity that not require the emperor at all.
- #Tokugawa-Ieyasu stablished a system where benefit the #daimyo who were allies at the #Sekigahara battle and punished the enemies.
	- 180 #daimyo were distributed domains, where they were only able to set 1 castle and were forbidden to form alliances with each other legally.
	- Allies were provided with the territories closer to Edo. 
	- Enemies were provided with distant territories. This will become a mistake as that meant later that they were more likely to have foreigner encounters. (tozama daimyo)
- To avoid uprisings, #daimyo were required to reside in Edo every other year and have their immediate family stay permanently as effective hostages. This was called #sankin-koutai.
	- The #sankin-koutai also kickstarted a national market that boosted the economy and stability through the 17th century.
	- This increased domestic trades, literacy and doubled Japan's population during that century.
	- This will however be capped due to the lack of resources to sustain the grow and will lead to economic and demographic stagnation until the arrival of the western.
- During the Tokugawa regime, the #shi-nou-kou-shou social hierarchal system was created.
	- Society was split into 4 categories.
		- Samurai (*shi*) at the top.
		- Farmers (nô).
		- Artisans (kô).
		- Merchants (shô) at the bottom.
	- This positions were designed by birth, which meant social mobility was almost impossible.
	- The system was funded under #confucian and #stoic #zen-buddhism principles. This helped develop a nationalize and rational model of political obligations, which discouraged dissent and resistance.
- Eventually, as merchants started to become richer and starvation became stronger for the farmer class, social discomfort started to grow.
- Samurai struggled to get respect as there was no war to fight in and demonstrate its value.
	- Samurai also were underline patrons to #ukiyo, red-light districts in the cities.
	- This patronage helped to boost the arts, such as ukiyoe and kabuki theater.
	- Ukiyo were a gray area since the earning and actors from there where legally outside the #shi-nou-kou-shou system.
- There was a constant tension between the traditional values and the search for modernity.
	- A group wanted to get back to imperial system, return their worth to their samurais, and dethrone the current government.
	- At the same time, in practice, huge part of the Samurai were never required to drawn their blade in their life so for many, they were more of a burden to society.
- National culture was blooming but ideological and economic issues were rising due to the social tension between clases.
- The country was in a stagnant process of modernization that lead to social frustration due to a polity that wanted to promote stasis and stability.

		- The increasing discontent from the tozama daimyo.

		- The pressure being exerted by the Western powers.
- 1866 
	- The tozama domains of Chôshû and Satsuma allied and exploited the long distance between them and Edo to cultivate knowledge about Western technology.
	- The #bakufu as well was getting help of #USA and #France to build a modern military.
	- When #Tokugawa-Yoshinobu launched a #bakufu attack on Chôshû due to its misadventures, looking to make an example of it, Satsuma refused to help them and as a result the #bakufu army was defeated and humiliated.
	- This lost led to increased social unrest and uprisings across the nation as the #bakufu was seen as inadequate to control the realm.

### 2 - Imperial revolution: embracing modernity
- 1968
	- #Emperor-Meiji moved capital from #Kyoto to Edo ( #Tokyo )
	- #Emperor-Meiji promulgates the #Charter-Oath, with 5 pledges:
		- Establish assemblies to allow the people to be involved in decision-making.
		- Involve *ALL* people, regardless of their social status, in affairs of the state.
		- Abolish restrictions  on the occupation and function for all the people.
		- Abandon the superstition of the past and embrace the rational law of nature instead.
		- Seek knowledge from around the world that would strengthen #Japan 
	- The #Charter-Oath was implemented as a way to make #Japan a modern polity so they could get rid of the #Unequal-Treaties and be considered equal in the international community.
- 1869
	- Japan assimilates #Hokkaido.
	- #Emperor-Meiji  establishes the *Tokyo shokonsha*, a national shrine to commemorate all the soldiers who died during the #Boshin-War in the name of imperial Japan.
	- Ranks of Samurai is reduced to two: higher and lower. This will eventually reduce the social impact of Samurai by removing the lower class first and then mixing them along the commoners.
- 1871
	- Japan sends an embassy called the #Iwakura-Embassy with a different purpose:
		- Attempt to renegotiate the #Unequal-Treaties with #USA and #Europe.

	- 
- 1872
	- #Fukuzawa-Yukichi publishes *Gakumon no susume* (The encouragement of learning) calling Japanese to abandon their traditional approach to knowledge and society organization, based on heredity and superstition, and strengthen the society by the use of equality of opportunities and that people should find their place based on merit and educational achievements of relations.
	- The position of #Fukuzawa-Yukichi was founded by the social Darwinism that #Herbert-Spencer had proposed and Fukuzawa had the idea that Japan needed to "catch up" with the West in order to survive in a modern international system. Japan was behind the West so their idea was that they needed to "catch up" so they could eventually overcome them, become more advanced and civilized. Their approach was to assimilate technology but to retain "Japanese/Eastern spirit".
	- 
 - 1873
	- Japan plots invasion of #Korea.
- 1876

- 1879
	- Japan assimilates #Okinawa.
	- *Tokyo shokonsha* is renamed to #Yasukuni-jinja, named that has to this day. This shrine remains controversial as for some it represents a disrespect to those who died for Imperial Japan, as contemporary Japan has failed to properly expose remorse for the aggression of the Imperial Army (1930-1940s) and to some indicate a sense of patriotism and respect for the history of modern #Japan. 
- 1880s
	- Japan starts improving education, getting rising literacy rates  and increasing print circulations that would promote the idea of Japan "catching up and overcoming".

		- A bicameral legislature with elected lower house and appointed upper house of peers.
		- Guarantees for range of rights and duties.
		- Emperor is still above the constitution's rules.
		- No concessions regarding #womans-rights. (#Japan saw the #womans-rights movements in Europe as a proof of them being morally defunct).
	- One of the reasons for the Meiji constitution was as a way for the #genro to forestall any possible discussion of #Japan becoming a republic and preserve the Emperor's power.
- 1890s
	- Japan has currency, national taxation system, bicameral legislature and a formal constitution.
		- This taxation system will fund the building of an army and allow the construction of a national railway system and modern factories, bringing the foundation to a modern economic system.
		- This will allow the connection between outlying regions and the capital, and allow greater urbanization.
	- Japan is started to be considered as the first modern Asian power under the slogan of *fukoku kyôhei* (rich country, strong army).

	- Nitobe Inazo publishes *"The soul of Japan"* in which he pushes the idea #bushido as a Japanese ideology, romanticizing the idea of Samurai as a warrior elite that was honorable and loyal, rather than the oppressive, unproductive and expensive privileged elite from the feudal past.
		- Nitobe saw #bushido as an answer to the problem of modernity: as an alternative that will mirror the deep-rooted systems of religious beliefs and ideology that gave European nations a coherent sense of identity and moral worth, but applied to Japan.
		- Japan was under the idea that they needed to modernize but no matter how much it may change, Japan must remain Japan.

### 3 - Overcoming and overcome by modernity: Japan at war
- After getting rid of the #Unequal-Treaties, Japan is now a confident nation but as it adopts modernity, it starts to question what it means to be Japanese.
- Japan also seems itself as having the moral mission to help other Asian nations to overcome the pressure from Western and the modernization; to free Asia from the grip of Western imperialism.
- To #Japan , it seemed natural that Japan, as it was now a modern nation, should have an empire of its own, like the powers from the West.
