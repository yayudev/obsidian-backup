### 1 - Hegel's times and life
- Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was born in Stuttgart, Germany in 1770.
- Lived the golden era of literature.
- #Kant said in *Critique of Pure Reason (1781)* that our mind is no merely passive receiver of information obtained by our eyes, ears and other senses. knowledge is only possible because our mind plays an active role, organizing and systematizing what we experience.
	- For #Kant everything we know is a representation of the world without the framework of our own knowledge, not an objective reality but a subjective idea of the world.
	- #Kant said the Independent Reality of the world —what #Kant called the world of the "thing-in-itself"— is for ever beyond our knowledge.
- #Kant and his readers believed that before their century was over they would be aver to complete all philosophy. However, gradually people started to disagree with his ideas.
- Johann #Fichte denied the existence of the "thing-in-itself". Since #Kant said that the "thing-in-itself" should be completely unknowable, yet according to #Fichte #Kant knew it existed, how was that even possible if nothing of it can be known?
	- To #Fichte, the whole word was something constituted of our active mind. What mind can't know does not exist.
- For #Schiller, #Kant's division of human nature into reason and passion was correct but portraying it as an eternal struggle between them was degrading and defeatist.
	- #Schiller mentioned that in Ancient Greece, there had been existed an harmonious union between reason and passion.
	- For #Schiller , the way to recover the harmony in the human existence was through the sense of aesthetic in every space of life.
	- #Hegel, however, thought that the answer was in philosophy, not aesthetics.
- For #Hegel, orthodox religion was a barrier in the goal of restoring man's harmony.

### 2 - History with a purpose
- #Hegel  took history seriously.
- #Hegel accepted #Schiller's suggestion that the very foundations of human condition could change from one historical era to another.
- For #Hegel, the philosophy of history is nothing but the thoughtful consideration of it. History should seek to present its raw material as part of a rational process of development, in order to reveal the meaning and significance of history itself.
- For most moderns though, history had no ultimate purpose, it was just a series of human purposes who conformed history itself.
- #Hegel in its *Philosophy of History*, states that ***"The history of the world is none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom."***
- ##### Philosophy of history
	- For #Hegel, The Oriental World 

### 3 - Freedom and community

### 4 - The odyssey of mind

### 5 - Logic and dialectics
