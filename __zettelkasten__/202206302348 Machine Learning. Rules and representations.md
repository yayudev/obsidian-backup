# Machine Learning. Rules and representations
----

- In order to learn, machine learning need 3 things:
1. Input data points
2. Example of expected outputs
3. A way to measure it's doing a good job

- Data represenatations are important because they define the way we can analize the data. 

- In order to optimize this and find better approaches, machine learning does automated transformations of the data guided by a feedback signal. This is what we call learning.
