# How does Deep Learning works?
----
- The *Deep* in *Deep Learning* refers to the approach in which several successive layers of data transformations are used to generate outcomes.
- Layers are generated automatically via models called **Neural Networks**.
- The way a layer modifies the data is stored in its **Weights**, which are just a bunch of numbers. This is called **Parameterization**.
- Learning is done through trying to find the best weight to generate the desired answer.
- The outcome is measured by a **Loss Function**, which checks how far the result produced by the network is from the expected answer and creates an score for that. 
- The loss function's score is used as a feedback signal to adjust the weights for the next try via an **Optimizer**.
- Cycle repeats to improve the accuracy.
