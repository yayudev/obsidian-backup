# Vector (Tensors)
----

- Vectors are *Rank-1* tensors. 
- They are 1-D arrays of numbers.
- They are good for simple datasets.

Examples:
- To represent a person's data we want to store the *age*, *gender* and *income*. We  can represent it as:

```js
	[18, 1, 10_000]
	// [age, gender(1=male, 2=female), income]
```
