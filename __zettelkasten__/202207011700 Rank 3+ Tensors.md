# Ranks 3+ tensors

----

- Tensors can have any N-dimmensions. (where N >= 0)
- As tensors reach higher dimmensions there's less applications so it lower rank tensors are more commonly used.
- Some examples of Rank 3+ tensors usages are:
	- [[202207011655 Tensors for Images]]
	- [[202207011703 Tensors for video]]
