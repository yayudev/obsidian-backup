# Data batches
----

- In deep learning, models are trained by spliting datasets into smaller batches.

- Example:
	- `training_images`  is our training dataset composed of 1024 images.
	- We want to train the model in batches of 128 images at a time.
	- So we would split it like:
	```python
	 first_batch = training_images[0:128]
	 second_batch = training_images[128:256]
	 # ...
	```
	- In a more general way, this would be:
	```python
	BATCH_SIZE = 128
	current_batch = training_images[BATCH_SIZE*n:BATCH_SIZE*(n+1)]
	# where n is the current batch index
	```

- When using batches, the resulting tensor's first axis is called **batch axis** or **batch dimmension**, and it describes the size of the batch.

- For the above example would be `(128, height, width, color_depth)`, where `128` is the size of the badge.
