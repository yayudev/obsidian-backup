# Broadcasting
----
- Broadcasting consist of projecting a lower dimmensional tensor into higher dimensions to be able to match the shape and perform operations with other tensors.
- The original vector is copied to fill highter dimensions
- Example:

```python
# Having this tensors
(3,) => 
	[1, 2, 3]

(2, 3) => 
	[
		[1, 2, 3],
		[4, 5, 6],
	]

# We can broadcast the first one to
(2, 3) => 
	[
		[1, 2, 3],
		[1, 2, 3]
	]

# And now you can do
[[1,2,3], [4,5,6]] + [[1,2,3],[1,2,3]] = [[2,3,6], [5,7,9]]
```
