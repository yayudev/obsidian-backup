# Vector-matrix dot product
---
- Apply vector-vector dot product to each row and the result is a vector with the result for each.
- The number of columns in the matrix must be the the same as the vector length.
- Example:
```python
[[1, 2], 
 [3, 4]] . [1, 2]
= [
   [1, 2].[1.2],
   [3, 4].[1.2]
  ]
= [
    (1*1 + 2*2),
    (3*1 + 4*2)
  ]
= [(1 + 4), (3 + 8)]
= [ 5, 11 ]
```
