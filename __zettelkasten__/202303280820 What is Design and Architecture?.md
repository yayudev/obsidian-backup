# What is Design and Architecture?

--- 
- Architecure and design refer to the same thing.
- Usually ***architecture*** is used to refer to big details only and ***design*** to small details but an architect should care about both high and low level details.
- [[Robert C. Martin - The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and mantain the required system]]
- The bigger lie engineers tell themselves is that writting messy code makes them go faster when in the short tem and it only becomes slowing in the long term.
- **In reality, making messes *ALWAYS* slows you down more than staying up clean, no matter what scale are you using.**
