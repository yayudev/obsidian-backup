# A tale of two values

--- 
- Every software provides two values to the stake holders: behaviour and structure.
- Providers make machines behave in a way that saves or produces money for the stakeholders.
- To fulfill its purpose, software must be easy to change.
- The difficulty in changing software should only be proportional to the scope of the change, not to the shape of the change.
- If an engineer preferes a specific shape over another, the more likely new features will be harder to implement.
- Architectures should be shape agnostic.
- Behaviour is urgent but not always particularly important.
- Architecture is always important but never particularly urgent.
- The responsability of a software development team should be to assert the importance of architecture over the urgency of features.
- The development team has to struggle over what  they believe is the best for the company.
- Developers should negotiate with other stakeholders as equals.
- Software developers ***are stakeholders**.
- A software architect should focus on the structure of the system more than in its particular feature or functons.
