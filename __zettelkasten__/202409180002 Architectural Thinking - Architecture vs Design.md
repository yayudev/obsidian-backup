# Architectural Thinking - Architecture vs Design
----
- Software development teams have been traditionally been split between software architect and software developers.
- In this division the Architect takes cares of characteristics of the system, defining patterns and styles and creating component-based structures.
- On the other hand, software developers usually handle tasks like creating and defining the classes for each component, writing the source code and generating UIs.
- The problem with this approach is that generates a gap between both parts, were the decisions the architect make don't get to the development team and decision done by the dev team don't get send back to the architect. Thus, these barriers must be broken down, both virtually and physically.
- **The software architect must be on the same team as the dev team**. This ensures that there's a strong bidirectional communication between both, as well as to allow mentoring and coaching from the architect to the software team.
