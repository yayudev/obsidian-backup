# Architectural Thinking - Technical Breadth
----
#### Knowledge

- The following pyramid  show all the technical knowledge that exists:
![[fosa_0206.png]]

- *Stuff you know* (L1): Technologies, Frameworks, Languages, Tools that you know and use constantly.
- *Stuff you know you don't know* (L2): Technologies that you are aware of that exists and what kind of problems they can fix but you haven't used or get to understand fully yet.
- *Stuff you know you don't know* (L3): Stuff you are not even aware that exists and may be able to fit or create the perfect solution for a problem that you want to solve.

##### Knowledge for software devs

- Early devs should focus on the top (L1) as technical expertise may pay off more early on.
- Focusing on L1 also incidentally increases L2 as you come across other technologies.
- L1, **the stuff you know, is also the stuff you must maintain**. In software nothing is static so becoming an expert means constantly keeping up to date on that topic to maintain expertise.

##### Knowledge for software architects

- The value of an architect is on the understanding of a broad number of technologies and how to use them to solve particular problems as they fit better.
- Thus, **for an architect, knowledge breadth is more important than depth.**
- [[For an architect, the wise course of action is to sacrifice some hard-won expertise and use that time to broaden their portfolio.]]
- Expertise may remain, probably around enjoyable areas, but others will atrophy, and that is not a bad thing.

- This shift in career approach can create potential dangers for the architect:
	- Frustration by trying to maintain expertise in a lot of areas while succeeding in none.
	- Stale expertise - Mistaken sensation that outdated information is still cutting edge.
	
- Risk assessment is important but should be always be realistic. Understanding the difference between genuine versus perceived technical risk is part the ongoing learning process for an architect..
