# Architectural Thinking - Analyzing Trade-Offs
----
- Every environment is different, every problem presents in different situations and with different conditions and requirements, thus every architecture will be different.
- [[Mark Richards - Architecture is the stuff you can't google]]

- An architect role is to understand the trade-offs of different approaches and make an informed decision based on those.
- [[Neal Ford - There are no right or wrongs answers in architecture --only trade-offs]]
- ***Programmers know the benefits of everything and the trade-offs of nothing. Architects needs to understand both.***
- As a dev, we usually see something shiny new and promote it based on the benefits but rarely we evaluate the cons or trade-offs of them.
- An architect, must see the benefits but also always analyze the negatives associated with a solution.
- **Everything in software architecture is a has a trade-off: and advantage and a disadvantage.**

- An architect must understand the business drivers to make the system succeed and translate them into characteristics(scalability, performance, availability).
- **A knowledge of business domain and collaboration with stake holders is required.**
