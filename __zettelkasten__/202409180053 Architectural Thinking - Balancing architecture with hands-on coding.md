# Architectural Thinking - Balancing architecture with hands-on coding
----
##### Avoid being a bottleneck
- Every architect should code and be able to maintain a certain level of technical depth.
- An architect can become a bottleneck to the dev team if the architect has the ownership of critical paths. This usually happens because the architect must balance playing both the dev and architect role.
- An architect should delegate the ownership of critical paths and framework code to other devs. It should be distributed across the team.
- An architect should focus on coding a feature 1-3 iterations down the road to gain hands-on experience and identify pain-points down the road.

##### Keeping hands-on experience and knowledge 
- Do frequent POCs, but keeping the best production quality possible.
	- POCs sometimes are used as base for the real thing so starting from a good quality starter is better.
	- Writing production-quality code forces to account for edge cases and take better decisions on the implementation.
	- Allows to test integration with the real system and account for different characteristics (scalability, performance, etc).
- Tackle tech debt or architecture stories.
	- Frees up dev team.
	- Low priority so no critical if there's not enough chance to complete.
- Working on bug fixes within an iteration.
	- Allows to identify issues and weakness within a codebase and possible architecture problems.
- Creating automations like CLIs and analyzers for the dev team.
	- Automate recurring tasks
	- Automate code-quality and linting for the team
	- Creates automated accountability and metrics to track quality
- Do code reviews
