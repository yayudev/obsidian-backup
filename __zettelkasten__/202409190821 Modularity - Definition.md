# Modularity 
----
- Modularity is the logical grouping of relate group in a unit, like a class or a function.
- How developers pack their code has implication in architecture of the system.
- Separation can be both logical or physical. (different domain vs different files or classes, for example).
- Having less modularity creates a really cohesive system but it's difficult  to extend it because is hard to break down into parts when everything is tightly coupled.
