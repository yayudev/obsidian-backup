#  Connascence
----
- Two components are connascent if changing one will require changing the other to avoid breaking the system.
- It links two components together.
- Connescence can have different forms:
	- Static:
		- Name -- Components agree on a way to name something
		- Type -- Linked by type definitions, like parameters.
		- Meaning -- Agree on the meaning of certain values (like 1 => true, 0 => false).
		- Position -- Order of values is important, like if I take func(String, String), the first String should be name and second last name.
		- Algorithm -- Multiple parts agree on using the same algo, like a parser and a decoder.
	- Dynamic:
		- Execution -- Order of execution matters.
		- Timing -- Time of execution matters.
		- Values -- Two separate values must be updated at the same time every time to keep them in sync.
		- Identity, 2 parts share the reference to the same entity/object.
		
- Ideally, we want to prefer having static conascence over dynamic one

#### How to handle it

- Break modules into encapsulated elements.
- Avoid crossing boundaries between encapsulated elements.
- Maximize connescence within a encapsulated artifact
